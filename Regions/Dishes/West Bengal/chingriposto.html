    <h1><span>Chingri Posto</span></h1> <!-- CHANGE -->
    <p>Chingri posto is a popular Bengali dish, featuring <b>prawns cooked in a rich curry made from a paste of poppy seeds</b>, known as “posto”.
        <br>
        <br>
        This dish is simple and easy to make, relying on just a few ingredients. However, it's the distinct nutty flavour of the posto that elevates the dish, making it exceptionally flavourful and aromatic. To achieve an authentic taste, make sure to use white poppy seeds and large prawns.
