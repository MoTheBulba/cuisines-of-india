    <h1><span>Haryana</span></h1> <!-- CHANGE -->
    <p>Haryana, <b>a northern state of India</b>, is renowned for its rich historical heritage, scenic landscapes, and significant archaeological sites.
        <br>
        <br>
        The cuisine of Haryana reflects its agricultural abundance and the cultural influences of the region. Notably, Haryana is celebrated for its cattle farming, particularly the Murrah buffalo and the Haryana cow. As a result, dairy products such as ghee, milk, and yogurt feature prominently in many Haryanvi dishes.
        <br>
        <br>
        While sharing similarities with Punjab's cuisine given their historical connection, Haryanvi cuisine maintains a distinct identity. Apart from dairy being more popular in Haryana, vegetarian dishes are more abundant in Haryanvi cuisine, particularly in rural areas where vegetarianism is often the norm. Additionally, Haryanvi dishes tend to be more simple, and are known for their wholesome and rustic flavours.
