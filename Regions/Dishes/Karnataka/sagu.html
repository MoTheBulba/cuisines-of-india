        <br>
        While various vegetables can be used, common choices include cauliflower, carrot, potato, and green beans. It is best to avoid using bitter vegetables such as okra or broccoli in this dish. Sagu is a type of kurma, which describes a creamy curry with a coconut base (while korma is a creamy curry with a dairy base). This dish offers exceptional comfort and nutrition, making it a popular healthy and filling choice. It is best served with dosa, idli, poori, or parotta either as a main or a side alongside other dishes.
