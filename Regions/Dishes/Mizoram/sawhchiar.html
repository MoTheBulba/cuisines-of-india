        <br>
        While chicken is the most common meat used, pork or beef can also be used. Vegetarian versions often use paneer or plenty of vegetables. Some recipes may opt to crush the rice before cooking, both to speed up the cooking process and to achieve a fluffier texture. Traditional recipes of sawhchiar typically use minimal ingredients, and modern versions use additional spices such as bay leaf or turmeric. Popular for its simplicity, comfort, and delicious taste, sawhchiar finds its place both in home kitchens and celebratory occasions alike.
