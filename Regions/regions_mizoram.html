    <p>Mizoram, <b>a northeastern Indian state</b> renowned for its stunning hills, mountains, and waterfalls, and offers a distinctive cuisine rooted in simplicity and freshness.
        <br>
        <br>
        Mizo cuisine predominantly revolves around rice-based meals complemented by a variety of meat dishes, and does not use many spices or other flavourings. Key ingredients in Mizo cooking include common local vegetables such as mushrooms, bamboo shoots, and leafy greens, which are often prepared through simmering or boiling methods. Mizo cuisine emphasises simple flavours that highlight the natural taste of the ingredients, resulting in dishes that are both delightful and light.
