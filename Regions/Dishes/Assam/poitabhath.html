    <p>Poitabhath is a traditional <b>fermented rice dish commonly prepared with yogurt or buttermilk.</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        Leftover cooked rice is soaked in water overnight and mixed with yogurt just before serving. It is important to note that leaving cooked rice unrefrigerated overnight may pose health risks due to bacterial growth. To minimise this risk, ensure that the rice is fully submerged in water during fermentation, taking care to add extra water if living in particularly warmer climates where evaporation may occur more rapidly.
        <br>
        <br>Poitabhath is not only flavourful but also nutritious, thanks to the fermentation process and the probiotics present in yogurt, which promote digestion and gut health. It is typically served cold and pairs wonderfully with aloo pitika (mashed potato balls).
