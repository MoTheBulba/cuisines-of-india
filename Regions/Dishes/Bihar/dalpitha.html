    <h1><span>Dal Pitha</span></h1> <!-- CHANGE -->
    <p>Dal pitha is a <b>rice dumpling stuffed with spiced dal</b>.
        <br>
        <br>
        These dumplings can be boiled or steamed until cooked through, and for some extra indulgence, quickly fried just before serving. The pithas are soft and chewy, with many variations in recipes across India. Dal pithas in particular are popular in Bihar. Instead of dal, pithas can be made sweet with jaggery and coconut. Whether savoury or sweet, pithas makes a satisfying snack by itself or served as a side dish.
