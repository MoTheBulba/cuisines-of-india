    <p>Matar ka nimona is a delicious curry made from <b>coarsely blended green peas and tender slices of potato.</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        While straightforward to prepare, this dish involves several steps â€“ blending the green peas, frying the peas and potatoes separately, and the beginning the curry. This dish has a wonderful balance of earthy, herby, and slightly sweet notes from the peas, complemented by the heartness of the potatoes. Some variations of this dish add leftover lentil fritters, adding an additional layer of complexity and a satisfying nutty undertone. Commonly enjoyed during the winter months, matar ka nimona is often served alongside flatbread or plain rice.
