    <h1><span>Nagaland</span></h1> <!-- CHANGE -->
    <p>Nagaland is <b>a northeastern Indian state</b>, and is home to stunning mountainous landscapes and celebrates its rich indigenous cultures.
        <br>
        <br>
        The state's cuisine can be described as a fusion of Indian and Eastern Asian culinary influences, resulting in a distinctive character shared with its northeastern neighbouring states. Fermented ingredients are often used and gives a tangy and umami-rich flavour profile to Nagaland's dishes, with axone (fermented soybean) being a popular ingredient.
        <br>
        <br>
        Interestingly, traditional Indian staples like onion, garlic, and ginger are not often used. Yet, Nagaland's cuisine still produces delicious and unique dishes. Notably, the region is known for its Naga chillies that provides an intense fiery heat.
