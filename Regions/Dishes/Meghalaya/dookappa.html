    <h1><span>Do'o Kappa</span></h1> <!-- CHANGE -->
    <p>Do'o kappa is <b>a chicken dish</b> originating from the Garo community within Meghalaya.
        <br>
        <br>
        Known for its heat, this dish is cooked with a generous amount of green chillies, with some recipes calling for as many as 15-20 chillies. However, adjustments can be made to suit varying spice preferences. Notably, no added oil is used and relies solely on the chicken's rendered fat for cooking. A unique ingredient is kalchi, a type of cooking soda derived from banana or cotton ash, although baking soda is a suitable substitute. Kalchi plays a crucial role in tenderising the chicken, resulting in a remarkably satisfying texture. Doâ€™o kappa is best served with plain rice.
