    <h1><span>Wahan Mosdeng</span></h1> <!-- CHANGE -->
    <p>Wahan mosdeng is a tasty pork salad popular in Tripura. This dish uses <b>raw aromatics, commonly red onions, ginger, green chillies, and culantro</b> â€” an herb with robust flavour and larger leaves compared to its coriander relative.
        <br>
        <br>
        It is a very easy dish to make, where the only cooking involved is the gentle simmering of pork until tender. Some variations include cooking the aromatics with the pork as a stir-fry. Wahan mosdeng is typically served with rice or chapati.
