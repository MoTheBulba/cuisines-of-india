        Bihar's cuisine consists of a blend of both vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes, which vary according to the seasons. A key staple ingredient in many dishes is sattu â€“ roasted gram flour. One distinctive aspect of Bihar's cuisine is its array of accompaniments that complement main meals. These accompaniments include raita, pickles, chutneys, and more, each adding layers of flavour and texture to each meal.
