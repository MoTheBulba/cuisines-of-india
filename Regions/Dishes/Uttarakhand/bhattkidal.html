    <h1><span>Bhatt Ki Dal</span></h1> <!-- CHANGE -->
    <p>Bhatt ki dal, or bhatt ki churkani, is a traditional dish from Uttarakhand made with <b>black soybeans and thickened with roasted atta (whole wheat flour).</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        This regional specialty highlights the unique flavour and texture of black soybeans, which are local to Uttarakhand but can be hard to find elsewhere. Bhatt ki dal is relatively straightforward to cook, although it requires a long cooking time to ensure the soybeans are tender, and that the texture is thick and creamy. Bhatt ki dal is a nutritional dish and is best served with plain rice or chapati.
