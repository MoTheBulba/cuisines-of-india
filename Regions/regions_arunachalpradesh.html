        Arunachalese cuisine predominantly uses a diverse variety of locally sourced ingredients such as meat, fish, and vegetables, with rice being a staple food item. Arunachal Pradesh uses a unique variety of rice known as Khamti rice, which has a sticky texture and often cooked within bamboo. Local herbs and seasonings are greatly used in Arunachalese cooking, typically made into pastes or dry mixes before being cooked.

        Food preferences and techniques vary among the diverse tribal communities in Arunachal Pradesh. Generally, their cuisine tends to be mild, with minimal use of spices. However, the region is known for its cultivation the intensely hot Bhut Jolokia, also known as the ghost chilli or king chilli. As a result, when spices are used in Arunachali dishes, they can be exceptionally spicy.
