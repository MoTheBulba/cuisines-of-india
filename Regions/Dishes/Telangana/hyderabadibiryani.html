    <h1><span>Hyderabadi Biryani</span></h1> <!-- CHANGE -->
    <p>Hyderabadi biryani is one of India's most renowned dishes, and is a deeply satisfying meal.
        <br>
        <br>
        This biriyani can be cooked in one of two ways: <b>the kacchi style</b> (semi-cooked rice and raw meat are cooked <i>together</i>) or <b>pakki style</b> (semi-cooked rice and raw meat are cooked <i>separately</i>). Both styles take a long time to prepare. The kacchi style in particular can be challenging to do, especially for first-time cooks.
        <br>
        <br>
        While traditionally made with mutton, chicken or lamb are also popular. Hyderabadi biryani is often found at gatherings and special occasions, highlighting its culturally significance.

        *Although Hyderabad is currently in Telangana, Hyderabadi biryani better represents Andra cuisine. Hyderabad was previously the capital of Andhra Pradesh before the state was split. In 2014, the Telegu-speaking region of Andra Pradesh officially became its own state â€“ Telangana.
