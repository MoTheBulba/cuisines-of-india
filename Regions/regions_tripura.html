    <h1><span>Tripura</span></h1> <!-- CHANGE -->
    <p>Situated in <b>northeastern India</b>, Tripura is known for its picturesque hills and exquisite handicrafts crafted from hand-woven cotton and bamboo.
        <br>
        <br>
        While Tripura's cuisine is often described as mild due to its minimal use of spices, it often uses a generous number of green chillies, lending a pleasant heat to many dishes. Perhaps the local chillies are mild or maybe Tripura locals have a high tolerance for spiciness. Either way, the Tripura cuisine offers a wonderful array of dishes where flavours commonly come from the aforementioned chillies, garlic, ginger, and fermented fish.
        <br>
        <br>
        The cuisine also relies on fresh, local produce that change with the season. From smoking and drying techniques to steaming and roasting, Tripura's cuisine uses a diverse range of cooking methods to create dishes that are as vibrant and diverse as the landscapes that inspire them.
