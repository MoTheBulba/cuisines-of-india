    <h1><span>Chole</span></h1> <!-- CHANGE -->
    <p>Chole refers to both <b>a chickpea curry</b> and the chickpea itself.
        <br>

        There are a variety of different recipes, and one popular variation is Amritsari Chole, known for its distinctive use of pomegranate and amchur (dried mango powder). Chole pairs well with most dishes, but its classic pairing is chole bhature â€“ a deeply satisfying combination of chole served alongside soft, deep-fried bread known as bhatura.
