        <br>
        While traditionally made with pork, variations using mutton, beef, or chicken can also be found. It is a memorable dish often prepared for special occasions such as weddings, Christmas, and other celebrations. The cooking process for Sorpotel is simple but time-consuming, requiring a minimum of a day to prepare. However, the wait is well worth it for its decadent taste. The dish is best enjoyed at least one day after cooking, allowing time for the meat to marinate in the gravy. Sorpotel pairs perfectly with rice or bread, offering a comforting and filling meal.
