        <br>
        <br>
        While there are many variations for this recipe, a popular ingredient used in Delhi is amchur powder, also known as dried mango powder, that gives it a tangy taste. A successful Delhi aloo paratha is one that has no burst filling and puffs up beautifully when cooking. This dish is incredibly versatile and can be served with anything or eaten by itself.
