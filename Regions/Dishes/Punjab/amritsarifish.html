    <h1><span>Amritsari Fish</span></h1> <!-- CHANGE -->
    <p>Amritsari fish is <b>a fried fish recipe</b> from the culinary hub of Amritsar in Punjab.
        <br>
        <br>
        The dish involves pan-frying masala-marinated fish until it becomes aromatic and crispy. The fish can be made into fritters, known as pakoras, by deep-frying them for an equally crispy but more indulgent result. A popular street food, Amritsari fish can be enjoyed with some chutney and a squeeze of lemon, or served as a flavourful side dish alongside a main meal.
