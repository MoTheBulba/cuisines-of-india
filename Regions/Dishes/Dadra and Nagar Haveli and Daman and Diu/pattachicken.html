    <h1><span>Patta Chicken</span></h1> <!-- CHANGE -->
    <p>Patta chicken, also known as jungle or junglee chicken, is a tribal dish where <b>chicken pieces are marinated in a coriander masala, then carefully wrapped in leaves before being cooked over an open fire</b>.
        <br>
        <br>
        While modern variations may incorporate ingredients like tomatoes, garam masala, and chili powder, traditional recipes often adhere to a simpler flavour profile, relying on a handful of local spices and ingredients. The cooking process imparts a heavenly aroma to the dish as the flavours meld together within the leaves. Patta chicken is typically enjoyed alongside rice rotis or plain rice.
