    <p>Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu is <b>a union territory in western India</b> formed by four districts that were former Portuguese colonies.
        <br>
        <br>
        The cuisine of this region is a fusion of Portuguese, South Gujarati, and Goan flavours, as well as local tribal traditions. Urban areas showcase modern versions of traditional tribal dishes. Key ingredients such as coriander, green chilies, garlic, ginger, turmeric, and onion form the cornerstone of many dishes in this region, imparting a herby and aromatic base to a wide variety of recipes.
