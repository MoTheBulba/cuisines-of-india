        The state's cuisine commonly includes rice and fish, with the prized hilsa fish being particularly popular. Shaped by a rich tapestry of cultures, including Mughal, South Indian, and European influences, West Bengal's culinary tradition offers a diverse array of flavours, ranging from subtle to bold. Notably, the Darjeeling district within West Bengal is renowned worldwide for producing Darjeeling tea, a beautiful and aromatic tea best enjoyed on its own.
