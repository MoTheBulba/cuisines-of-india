    <h1><span>Karnataka</span></h1> <!-- CHANGE -->
    <p>Karnataka, <b>a coastal state in southern India</b> famed for its breathtaking national parks and vibrant culinary scene, offers a diverse variety of flavours and dishes deeply rooted in tradition.
        <br>
        <br>
        Central to Karnataka's culture is its love for rice. The cuisine is influenced by the many local cultural traditions and geographical diversity, where some regions predominantly eat vegetarian dishes and prefer meat and seafood dishes. Similar to other south Indian cuisines, Karnataka commonly uses coconut oil, fresh coconut, and curry leaves.
