        <br>
        <br>
        Traditionally slow cooked in a clay pot, giving it a subtle smokiness, ubadiyu is a comforting and warming meal, popular during the cold seasons. A variety of different vegetables can be used, including potato, plantain, broad beans, and aubergines. Ubadiyu can be enjoyed on its own, accompanied by chaas (buttermilk) and a side of coriander chutney, or served alongside plain rice.
