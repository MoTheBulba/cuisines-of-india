    <p>Maas podichath is a <b>flavourful tuna stir-fry prepared with coconut, onions, and spices.</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        This dish has a dry and flaky texture, and is a quick and easy option for a meal. While traditionally made with dried tuna, canned tuna with most of its water squeezed out can serve as a suitable substitute. Be aware, the flavour will not be the same. Variations of the recipe exist, with some frying the ingredients while others mix everything without cooking. Maas podichath is typically served with rice or chapati, or as a side accompanying other dishes.
