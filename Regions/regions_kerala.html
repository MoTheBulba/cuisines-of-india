    <h1><span>Kerala</span></h1>
    <p>Kerala is a <b>tropical state in southern India</b> known for its palm-fringed beaches, beautiful hill stations, and tranquil backwaters. <br>
        <br>
        Rice serves as the staple food in Kerala's cuisine, accompanied by an array of vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes. Common ingredients such as curry leaves, coconut, green chillies, and mustard seeds are used throughout Kerala. Given its proximity to the sea, Kerala is also celebrated for its abundance of fresh and flavourful seafood. Keralaâ€™s cuisine reflects its historical interactions with various foreign nations, most prominently the British and the Portuguese. <br>
        </br>
        The cuisine can be broadly categorized into three groups based on religion: Hindu, Muslim, and Christian. This division reflects each religion's local culture rather than religious practices. For instance, dishes like puttu (steamed rice and coconut) are often paired with meat in Muslim cuisine, while kappa (tapioca) and ishtu (stew) are more prevalent in Christian households.</p>
