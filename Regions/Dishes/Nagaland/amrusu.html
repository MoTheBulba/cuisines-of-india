    <h1><span>Amrusu</span></h1> <!-- CHANGE -->
    <p>Amrusu is a traditional comfort dish from the Ao tribe in Nagaland, consisting of <b>spicy rice porridge with meat that is usually chicken or pork.</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        Variations may include substituting the meat with dried fish/prawns or fermented bamboo shoots. 
        The recipe for Amrusu highlights the spiciness of its chilies, so it is recommended not to add too many chilies, as “less is more” in this dish. With its simplicity and comforting qualities, Amrusu serves as a warming and tasty dish, perfect for enjoying during chilly weather or as a hearty meal.
