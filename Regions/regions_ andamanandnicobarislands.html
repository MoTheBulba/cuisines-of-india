    <h1><span>The Andaman and Nicobar Islands</span></h1> <!-- CHANGE -->
    <p>The Andaman and Nicobar Islands, <b>a union territory nestled in the Bay of Bengal to the east of India</b>, has a rich history shaped by various colonial powers and cultural exchanges.
        <br>
        <br>
        Originally inhabited by indigenous tribes, the islands have witnessed the influences of other nations such as Britain, Malaysia, Sri Lanka, and historic Bengal over the centuries. Following World War II, the islands were transferred to India by the British. This diverse historical background has contributed to the cuisine seen in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands today.
        <br>
        <br>
        In urban and tourist areas, the cuisine reflects a fusion of South Indian, Sri Lankan, Bengali, and Malaysian influences. However, in rural and tribal regions, some remnants of traditional cuisine can be found, which is predominantly non-vegetarian and relies heavily on locally available ingredients.
