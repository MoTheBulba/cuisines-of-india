        <h1>About</h1>
        <p> I’m Mo. This website started off as a personal cooking project that took
            me through the dishes from each state and union territory within India.
            I posted about my project first in 2022 on
            <a target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/x041bx/week_1_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/">r/IndianFood on reddit</a>.
            I wanted a fun way to document the dishes I tried, so I created this website in 2024. 
            <br>
            <br>
            I don’t mind if you use any of the information here, but please refer back to this website if you do!
            <br>
            <br>
            I hope you enjoy this website, and happy learning!

            <summary><i>Why are there no recipes?</i></summary>
                <p>I am not a recipe creator, I just like collecting information on food and categorising the dishes I tried. The recipes I have used are from others and it wouldn’t be right to simply write them here. Some of my recipes have also been a combination of recipes I found online, but it would be hard to write them down because I cook from my heart and it is very hard to verbalise my intuition. I also have no idea whether my recipes are any good.
                <br>
                <br>
                However, many people have asked for recipes, so I am now in the process of writing them down. In the meantime, there are great recipes out there for each of the dishes listed here, so please have a Google for them. </li>

                <p>
                 I don’t! But I try my best. Very briefly, this is my process:
                <br>
                <br>
                 I first look at a combination of sources - local government tourism websites, wiki, Indian food blogs, etc. I find the common dishes they mention and then I Google/YouTube those recipes in the language of that state/territory. E.g. I looked up recipes in Tamil for dishes from Tamil Nadu. I also have redditors commenting suggestions too, I look them up in the same way and decide from there.
                <br>
                <br>
                I know my method is not that structured but it's hard to get the right recipes for regions that are not as popular or doesn't have a local cuisine due to their culture declining (like the Andaman and Nicobar islands). So multiple sources and cross-checking is my current method.

            <summary><i>If you look up recipes in different languages, how do you understand the recipe?</i></summary>
                <p>
                Indian recipes generally use the same ingredients, they are just used in different ways. I also know the names of the ingredients in Hindi and Malayalam, and the ingredient names tend to be the same (or similar) across Sanskrit and Dravidian languages respectively. For other language groups, they tend to say the name in English or I can tell what it is from the video. Otherwise, I just google any ingredients based on pronunciation/spelling and hope I figure it out.
                <br>
                <br>
                For the cooking method, usually there is a video or a good written description. Uncommon dishes, particularly with tribal or very rural dishes, are harder to figure out because it may not be clear from the video/writing. In this case, I try to fill in the gaps based on my experience. Not sure how authentic the dishes end up being, so I guess I just need to visit these places to experience it! Ah, if only I had the money.

                Yes indeed! I am a Keralite and I was brought up abroad.
