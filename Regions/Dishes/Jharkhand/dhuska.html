    <h1><span>Dhuska</span></h1> <!-- CHANGE -->
    <p>Dhuska is a popular breakfast or snack item that is made from <b>a batter of rice and dal, and deep-fried until golden.</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        While not technically a bread as no wheat is used, it serves a similar purpose as a carb staple. The key to achieving a soft and crispy texture, and making sure it does not deflate after cooking, is properly heated oil when deep-frying. Dhuska pairs exceptionally well with gravy or potato dishes, or even pickle accompaniments.
