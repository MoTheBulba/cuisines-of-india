    <h1><span>Goshtaba</span></h1> <!-- CHANGE -->
    <p>Goshtaba is a <b>yogurt-based dish made with large, velvety meatballs,</b> and is traditionally part of an elaborate feast called Wazwan in Kashmir.
        <br>
        <br>
        Wazwan is a 36-course meal and is prepared for celebratory occasions such as weddings. Goshtaba is typically made with mutton but some recipes use chicken as well. The signature velvety meatball texture comes from finely grinding the meat with some sort of fat, usually mutton fat but eggs or ghee can be used too.
        <br>
        <br>
        Although the dish is simple to make, it can take a long time to make sure the meatballs are tender. However, the resulting meal is incredibly satisfying and well worth the wait. Goshtaba is best served with plain rice.
