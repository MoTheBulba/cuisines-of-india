    <h1><span>Farata</span></h1> <!-- CHANGE -->
    <p>Farata is a type of <b>flatbread made from maida (plain flour)</b>, offering a soft and fluffy texture distinct from the typical atta (whole wheat) flatbreads found across India.
        <br>
        <br>
        It is excellent for soaking up thick curries and gravies. Often served alongside seafood dishes, particularly fish curry, farata is usually eaten for breakfast but can be served at other mealtimes too.
