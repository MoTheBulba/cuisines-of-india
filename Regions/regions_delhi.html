    <h1><span>Delhi</span></h1> <!-- CHANGE -->
    <p>Delhi, <b>a union territory and the capital territory of India</b>, serves as a vibrant melting pot of Indian cultures, reflected prominently in its diverse culinary landscape.
        <br>
        <br>
        A few notable cuisines are the Kayasth and Mughlai cuisines. Kayasth cuisine, rooted in traditional Hindu culinary traditions, was influenced by the Mughal Empire, offering rich and slow-cooked meat dishes, particularly mutton, prepared to perfection. Mughlai cuisine, originating from the Mughal era, brings together Central Indian and Persian culinary traditions, and is globally famous for its dishes such as biryani and kebabs. Additionally, Delhi is celebrated for its variety of iconic street foods and charming cafes, making it a paradise for food enthusiasts.
