    <p>Phingsha is <b>a flavourful dish made with meat, vegetables, and vermicelli glass noodles.</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        This dish can feature beef, pork, or chicken, and may include various vegetables such as potatoes or mushrooms. However, it can also be prepared without vegetables. Phingsha is relatively simple to make, and results in a spicy and comforting meal. It is commonly served with rice or flatbread, or as a side with other dishes.
