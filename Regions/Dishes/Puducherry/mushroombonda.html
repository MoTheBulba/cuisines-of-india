    <p>Mushroom bonda is <b>a deep-fried snack of potato and mushroom coated in a gram flour batter.</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        While bonda generally refers to deep-fried dough balls made with various batters such as gram flour, dal, or maida, mushroom bonda offers a unique twist with its savoury mushroom and potato filling. Although not a traditional variation, mushroom bonda became popular as street food in Pondicherry, particularly along Mission Street. Quick to make, it is a satisfying and indulgent snack.
