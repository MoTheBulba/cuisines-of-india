    <h1><span>Dohneiiong</span></h1> <!-- CHANGE -->
    <p>Dohneiiong is <b>a traditional pork dish</b> from the Khasi community within Meghalaya, consisting of the <b>distinctive flavour of nigella seeds</b>, also known as onion seeds.
        <br>
        <br>
        Soft boiled, tender pork is fried in mustard oil alongside aromatic spices and roasted nigella seeds. As this dish uses few ingredients, dohneiiong relies heavily on the abundant use of nigella seeds, which gives it a deeply satisfying taste and a visually striking dark colour. Dohneiiong is best served with plain rice.
