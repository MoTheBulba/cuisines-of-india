    <h1><span>Recheado Fish Fry</span></h1> <!-- CHANGE -->
    <p>Recheado fish fry is a simple yet flavourful dish made with <b>firm fish marinated in a special masala paste and fried until crispy</b>.
        <br>
        <br>
        The marination is key, where the fish is coated and stuffed with the masala paste to ensure thorough coverage. While there are various ways to prepare the masala paste, one essential ingredient is an abundance of red chilies that gives the dish its spiciness and beautiful colour. Recheado fish fry is best served with a squeeze of lemon juice and fresh rice.
