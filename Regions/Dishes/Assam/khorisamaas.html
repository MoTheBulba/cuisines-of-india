    <h1><span>Khorisa Maas</span></h1> <!-- CHANGE -->
    <p>Khorisa maas is a traditional Assamese dish consisting of <b>fried fish and bamboo shoots in a mild curry base.</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        Fresh fish pieces are marinated and fried before being added to the curry, which generally includes bamboo shoots as a primary ingredient. Both fermented and fresh bamboo shoots can be used in this dish, with fermented bamboo imparting a unique, tangy flavour that is popular across Assam. It is important to note that fermented bamboo has a strong, distinctive aroma that may not be pleasant for some. Khorisa maas is quick and simple to make, and can be served with plain rice.
