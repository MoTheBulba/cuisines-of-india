    <h1><span>Himachal Pradesh</span></h1> <!-- CHANGE -->
    <p>Himachal Pradesh is a <b>northern Indian state</b> and hosts stunning natural landscapes and culturally significant historical sites.
        <br>
        <br>
        Its cuisine is influenced by its neighbouring regions of Punjab and Tibet, as well as its unique local traditions. It is generous in its use of yogurt, cardamoms, and chickpeas, lending a distinct flavour profile to many traditional dishes. Himachali cuisine also features an abundance of locally sourced ingredients such as buckwheat, barley, and fresh mountain herbs, reflecting the region's agricultural abundance and rich biodiversity.
