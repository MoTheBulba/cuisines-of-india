        The state’s cuisine reflects its unique geographical location and cultural tapestry. Influenced by its neighbouring countries of Bhutan, Tibet, and Nepal, as well as its rich mosaic of ethnic tribes and communities, Sikkimese cuisine is a wonderful fusion of flavours and traditions. Sikkim’s cuisine is filled with fresh vegetables and grains, including rice, millet, and barley, and is often tangy and spicy in flavour. Of note, Sikkim's cuisine and agriculture is committed to 100% organic and sustainable farming practices.
