        Chhattisgarh is sometimes nicknamed the "rice bowl" of India due to its immense agricultural production of rice. It also has numerous ways of cooking rice, and rice is a staple food item eaten alongside many of its dishes. Chhattisgarhâ€™s cuisine reflects its local tribal and urban culture, as well as the influence of its neighbouring states such as Jharkhand and Telangana. Many of its dishes are fresh and considered healthy as minimal oil is used and filled with lentils, millets, and a variety of vegetables and fruits.
