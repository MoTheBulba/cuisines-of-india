    <h1><span>Bai</span></h1> <!-- CHANGE -->
    <p>Bai is <b>a nutritious vegetable stew</b> from Mizoram, known for its <b>light and thin consistency that uses local seasonal vegetables, and sometimes meat or fish.</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        Two key ingredients in bai are baking soda and saum, a traditional ingredient made from fermented pork fat. Outside of Mizoram, saum may be challenging to find and so additional oil can be used as a substitute. Vegetarian versions may use fermented soybean paste instead. Bai is an easy and quick dish to make and is particularly comforting during colder weather. It pairs well with rice, but it can also be enjoyed by itself.
