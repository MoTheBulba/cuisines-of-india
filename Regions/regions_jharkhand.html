    <h1><span>Jharkhand</span></h1> <!-- CHANGE -->
    <p>Jharkhand, <b>an eastern Indian state</b> known for its breathtaking wildlife reserves and beautiful waterfalls, offers a cuisine rooted in simple and fresh ingredients.
        <br>
        <br>
        Its dishes are simple yet bursting with flavour, and wholesome staples such as rice and dal are commonly paired with an array of local vegetables. While Jharkhand's cuisine is generally known for its mild spicing, there are certain dishes that offer bold and aromatic flavours. Meat-based preparations, such as beautifully spiced curries and grilled specialties, are popular in many parts of Jharkhand.
