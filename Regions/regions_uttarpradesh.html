        <br>
        Uttar Pradesh's cuisine can broadly be categorised into four main subsets: Awadhi, Mughlai, Bhojpuri, and local native cuisines. Awadhi and Mughlai cuisines have rich, meat-centric dishes, often prepared with elaborate techniques and fragrant spices. On the other hand, Bhojpuri cuisine tends to be milder, featuring a wide array of both vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes. The wealth of native Uttar Pradeshâ€™s cuisine reflect regional cultures and a diverse variety of ingredients and cooking styles can be found across the state.
