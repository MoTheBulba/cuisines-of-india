    <h1><span>Gatte Ki Sabzi</span></h1> <!-- CHANGE -->
    <p>Gatte ki sabzi is a <b>traditional Rajasthani curry with dumplings made from besan (gram flour), cooked in a rich, dairy-based gravy.</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        The preparation involves several steps: first, making and shaping the dough into dumplings, then boiling them, followed by chopping and frying before adding them to the curry base. Despite the multiple steps, the process is straightforward and results in a hearty and nutritious dish.
        <br>
        <br>
        There are many versions of gate ki kabzi, with one notable version known as shahi gatte, which stuffs the dumplings with grounded nuts. Other versions may substitute the dairy base with a tomato base for a different curry flavour profile. Traditionally served with rice or chapati, gatte ki sabzi is celebrated for its comforting texture and rustic flavours.
