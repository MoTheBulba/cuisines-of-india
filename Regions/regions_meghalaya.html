        The state's culinary heritage reflects the rich cultural tapestry of its indigenous communities: the Khasis, Jaintia, and Garos. While rice and pork are common across these communities, each tribe has its unique culinary traditions and preferred ingredients. For instance, fermented soybean features prominently in Khasi and Jaintia cuisines, whereas the Garos have a penchant for kalchi, a type of cooking soda.
