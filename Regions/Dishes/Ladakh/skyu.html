    <h1><span>Skyu</span></h1> <!-- CHANGE -->
    <p>Skyu is a <b>traditional hearty pasta soup</b> hailing from Ladakh that consists of <b>stir-fried vegetables, spices, milk, and pasta made from atta flour.</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        The pasta is especially distinctive because of its little dimples. Skyu's quick preparation and warming nature makes it a convenient and satisfying meal, particularly during the colder months. This dish typically uses local, seasonal vegetables, and is often enjoyed by itself or alongside other dishes.
