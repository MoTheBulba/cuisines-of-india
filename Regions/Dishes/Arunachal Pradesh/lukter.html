    <h1><span>Lukter</span></h1> <!-- CHANGE -->
    <p>Lukter is a <b>crispy and spicy meat dish, commonly prepared using bhut jolokia chili peppers and dried bamboo shoots</b>.
        <br>
        <br>
        Any meat can be used, such as pork or chicken, which is boiled and shredded before being fried. Due to the use of bhut jolokia, it's important to handle the chili peppers with gloves and ensure proper ventilation by opening windows or doors while frying them. The dish itself is inherently spicy, but when served as part of a meal alongside other dishes, the spice level is balanced out. Lukter can be enjoyed as a standalone, crunchy snack, or as a side dish paired with rice and other accompaniments.
