    <p>Assam is a <b>northeastern Indian state</b> renowned for its tea, silk, and diverse wildlife.

        <br>
        Assamese cuisine was heavily influenced by its environment that led to preservation techniques, such as fermenting and drying, to extend the shelf life of food and has now become integral to Assamese cooking. Assamese food generally has a mild flavour profile, with minimal use of spices, and often has a tangy or sour taste derived from commonly used fermented ingredients.
