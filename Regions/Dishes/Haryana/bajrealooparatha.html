    <h1><span>Bajre Aloo Paratha</span></h1> <!-- CHANGE -->
    <p>Bajra aloo paratha is a <b>flatbread made with bajra flour (i.e. pearl millet flour), seasoned with spices, and mixed with mashed potato to form a dough before being flattened and cooked</b>.
        <br>
        <br>
        Until the more common aloo paratha, the potato here is mixed into the dough and not stuffed. This dough can be difficult to roll due to its texture, and instead the dough can be pressed into shape. Bajra aloo paratha is a healthy and tasty flatbread and arguably easier to make than a stuffed aloo paratha.
