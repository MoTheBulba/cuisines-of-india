    <p>Pulusu Pindi, known by various names such as uppindi, puli upma, and tamarind upma, essentially refers to a tangy or sour upma. It is made from <b>ground rice and tamarind cooked with tempered spices.</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        The dish has many variations and may also be made from semolina or lentils, or even a combination of semolina, lentils, or rice. This light dish is popularly consumed for breakfast and can be enjoyed on its own or eaten with some South Indian chutney or pickle*.

        <br>
        *Indian chutneys and pickles differ greatly from those found elsewhere in the world, and even within India itself. If you choose to eat this dish with a chutney or pickle, use a South Indian variety. However, feel free to eat it with any side dish of your choiceâ€”food is best when you enjoy it!
