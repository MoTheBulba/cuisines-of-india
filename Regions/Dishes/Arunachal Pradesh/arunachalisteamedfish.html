    <h1><span>Arunachali Steamed Fish</span></h1> <!-- CHANGE -->
    <p>Arunachali steamed fish is a popular dish that uses <b>fresh, local fish marinated in a flavourful herb paste and steamed inside banana leaves</b>.
        <br>
        <br>
        There are numerous variations of this dish, but it typically includes ingredients such as garlic, ginger, hooker chives, and bamboo shoots. The fish used is usually freshwater fish, either cooked whole after cleaning and gutting or cut into steaks. The use of banana leaves gives a lovely sweet-savoury flavour to the dish, with a wonderful aroma. Preparation is simple and quick, and pairs excellently with rice and vegetables.
