    <p>Kori Gassi is <b>a fiery Mangalorean chicken curry prepared with a red chilli chutney and coconut milk.</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        The name 'kori' mean chicken, while 'gassi' means curry. This dish features a rich array of ingredients, including poppy seeds, fenugreek seeds, cashew nuts, and more, although recipe variations may omit certain ingredients. The vibrant colour of this curry is attributed to the generous use of roasted chilies. Known for its beautifully rich and deep flavours, kori gassi is a popular choice for dinner parties and celebrations. It is best served with plain rice or a thick flatbread that soaks up the delicious gravy.
