    <p>Manipur kangshoi is <b>a thin stew made by simmering vegetables and smoked fish</b>, and it can also be prepared as a vegetarian dish.
        <br>
        <br>
        A key local ingredient in this dish is ngari, a fermented freshwater fish known as pool barb. However, ngari can be difficult to find, and suitable substitutes include dried fish, anchovy paste, fish sauce, or fermented fish paste. For a vegetarian version, fermented soybean paste can be used instead.
        <br>
        <br>
        Preparation of Manipur kangshoi is straightforward: all ingredients are combined in a pot and simmered until cooked through. To make the flavour more complex, layer the ingredients by adding the aromatics first, followed by vegetables, and finally the fish. “Kangshoi” means stew and can include other ingredients such as chicken, but the most commonly found recipe uses vegetables and smoked fish.
