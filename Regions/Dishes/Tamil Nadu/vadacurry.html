    <h1><span>Vada Curry</span></h1> <!-- CHANGE -->
    <p>Vada curry is a delicious and comforting Tamil dish made with <b>lentil fritters in a spicy, coconut curry</b>.
        <br>
        <br>
        The “vada”, or lentil fritters, has few ingredients and is beautifully crispy and golden-brown. The vada can be enjoyed by itself as snack with coconut chutney and tea, but the vada can be transformed into a satisfying meal by making it into a curry. It is best served with idli or dosa but can also be eaten with chapati or rice.
