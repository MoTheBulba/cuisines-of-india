    <p>Phagshapa is <b>a pork dish cooked with chillies and white radish.</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        Known for its simplicity, this dish uses minimal ingredients yet offers a comforting and flavourful experience from the aromatics and use of fatty pork cooked until tender. The number of chillies used can be adjusted to the level of spice required. Phagshapa is often enjoyed during the summer months and is best served with plain rice for a simple yet satisfying meal.
