    <h1><span>Khambir</span></h1> <!-- CHANGE -->
    <p>Khambir is a <b>traditional flatbread made with fermented atta dough.</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        It is a simple bread to make, with a slightly tangy taste similar to sourdough bread. For an enhanced smoky flavour, khambir is often finished by grilling or cooking over an open fire until it develops a slight char. Traditionally, khambir is paired with a butter tea, which has a savoury and a mildly salty taste. Butter tea may be an acquired taste for those accustomed to milky or plain black tea. Khambir can be enjoyed either on its own with a generous dollop of ghee or as an accompaniment to various dishes.
