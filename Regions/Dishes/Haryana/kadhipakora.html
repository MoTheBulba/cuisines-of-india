    <h1><span>Kadhi Pakora</span></h1> <!-- CHANGE -->
    <p>Kadhi pakora is a classic <b>yogurt-based curry with onion fritters</b>, aptly named for its two main components: “kadhi,” referring to the yogurt-based curry, and “pakora” meaning fritter.
        <br>
        <br>
        The sweet pakoras soak up the tangy curry that results in a beautifully flavourful dish. Kadhi pakora is a traditional Punjabi dish but it is also commonly eaten in Haryana too. Easy to prepare with many variations in recipes, it is best served with rice or flatbread.</p>
