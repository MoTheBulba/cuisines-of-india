    <h1><span>Mirchi Vada</span></h1> <!-- CHANGE -->
    <p>Mirchi vada, also known as mirchi bada, is a popular street food snack made from <b>deep-fried chilli peppers stuffed with a seasoned potato mixture and enveloped in a crispy gram flour batter.</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        Despite its name, the dish is not overwhelmingly spicy, as the chillies' seeds and membranes are typically removed before stuffing. However, for those seeking an extra kick of heat, the chilli innards can be mixed with the potato before stuffing. Cauliflower is sometimes used instead of potato in a variation of its recipe. Mirchi vada is often served with a choice of condiments, such as a masala tomato sauce or green chutney.
