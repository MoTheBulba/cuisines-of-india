    <h1><span>Awaan Bangui</span></h1> <!-- CHANGE -->
    <p>Awaan bangui is a wonderful rice dish from Tripura, made with <b>sticky rice cooked in a banana leaf.</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        This traditional recipe has a few variations, such as adding cashew nuts and raisins, or grated carrot. One of the highlights of preparing awaan bangui is the entertaining process of stuffing the raw rice mixture into a banana leaf cone, making it a fun activity to share with family and friends. Awaan bangui can be paired with a variety of dishes, but it is most commonly enjoyed alongside another Tripuri favourite â€“ wahan mosdeng, a pork salad dish.
