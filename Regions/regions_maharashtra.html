        Maharashtrian cuisine is a blend of mild and spicy flavours, often with some tanginess. As the home of the famous Mumbai, Maharashtra is known for its vibrant street food culture, offering iconic dishes like pav bhaji and bhel puri. In contrast to its street food scene, Maharashtra also encompasses a wide array of home-style dishes that are both nutritious and flavourful, such as Marathi khichdi and vangi bhaat (eggplant rice).
