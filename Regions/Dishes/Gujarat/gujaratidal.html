    <h1><span>Gujarati Dal</span></h1> <!-- CHANGE -->
    <p>Gujarati dal is a <b>general name for a variety of different lentil curries from Gujurat</b>.
        <br>
        <br>
        One of the most common recipes offers a thick, sweet, and tangy dal with a smooth texture. It is known for its complex and satisfying flavours, including nuttiness from peanuts and spiciness from chillies.
        <br>
        <br>
        Kokum is typically used for the tangy flavour, but lemon juice or tamarind can be used as a substitute. This version of Gujarati dal is best enjoyed with chapati but can also be served with plain rice.
