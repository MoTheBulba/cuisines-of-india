    <h1><span>Rajma</span></h1> <!-- CHANGE -->
    <p>Rajma is a popular Punjabi <b>kidney bean curry simmered in a thick tomato base.</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        It is simple to make and tastes even better the next day. The term “rajma” not only refers to the dish, but also to the red kidney beans. Rajma is made by layering aromatics and spices to make an incredibly flavourful and comforting dish that pairs well with plain rice. Cheap, healthy, and quick to make – a wonderful recipe indeed.
