    <h1><span>Telangana</span></h1> <!-- CHANGE -->
    <p> Telangana, <b>a state in southern India</b>, is renowned for its globally famous film industry and historical landmarks.
        <br>
        <br>
        The cuisine of Telangana has strong tangy and spicy flavours from common ingredients like tamarind and chillies. Staple foods include rice, lentils, millets, and nuts, which lend richness and heartiness to many traditional dishes.
        <br>
        <br>
        It's worth noting that Hyderabadâ€™s cuisine, the capital of Telangana, differs from the rest of the state due to its strong Mughlai influence. Here, one can try a variety of indulgent and meat-centric dishes such as biryani and haleem, reflecting the fusion of local flavours with Mughlai culinary traditions.
