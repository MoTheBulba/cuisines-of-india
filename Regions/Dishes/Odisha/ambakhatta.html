    <h1><span>Amba Khatta</span></h1> <!-- CHANGE -->
    <p>Amba khatta is <b>a simple sweet and sour chutney made with raw mangoes, jaggery, and a spice blend known as panch phoron.</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        The term “amba” means mango while “khatta” means sour. This chutney only uses few ingredients and is quick to make. Once cooked, the dish has an incredibly appetising aroma. Served as a side dish, amba khatta pairs beautifully with various savoury dishes or it can be enjoyed on its own alongside rice or a flatbread.
