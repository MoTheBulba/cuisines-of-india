    <h1><span>Siddu</span></h1> <!-- CHANGE -->
    <p>Siddu is a <b>soft and fluffy steamed bun that can be filled with either savoury or sweet ingredients</b>.
        <br>
        <br>
        Savory fillings may include nuts, lentils, beans, and more, while sweet variations often use jaggery. Before serving, Siddu is typically topped with ghee for a rich flavour. This warming snack is particularly popular during colder seasons and is often served to guests during festivals and other special occasions. Savory siddu pairs well with dal or chutney, while sweet siddu can be enjoyed on its own.
