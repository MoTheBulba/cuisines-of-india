    <h1><span>Litti Chokha</span></h1> <!-- CHANGE -->
    <p>Litti chokha is a popular Bihari dish consisting of two components: <b>litti, small balls made from wheat flour and stuffed with spiced sattu (roasted chickpea flour)</b>, and <b>chokha, a spiced mashed vegetable mixture</b>.
        <br>
        <br>
        Sattu can be difficult to find in shops outside India but it can be made easily at home dry-roasting chickpeas and grinding them to a powder. While litti chokha can be time-consuming to perpare, it is worth the effort for the resulting indulgent, comforting, and satisfying dish.
