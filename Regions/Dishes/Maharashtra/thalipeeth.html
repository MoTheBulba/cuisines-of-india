    <p>Thalipeeth is a <b>crispy and flavourful multi-flour flatbread</b> originating from Maharashtra.
        <br>
        <br>
        It consists of a blend of sorghum flour, atta (whole wheat flour), rice flour, besan (gram flour), and bajra (pearl millet flour), seasoned with aromatics and spices such as onions, cumin, and turmeric. Unlike many Indian flatbreads, thalipeeth does not need to rest due to its low gluten content.
        <br>
        <br>
        Once the dough is formed, it can be cooked immediately. Rather than rolling out the dough, it is flattened with oily hands on an oiled surface and poked with 5-6 holes to ensure even cooking. While some recipes call for deep frying, thalipeeth is commonly pan-fried. This nutritious dish is rich in flavour and can be enjoyed on its own or paired with yogurt or pickle.
