    <h1><span>Gujarat</span></h1> <!-- CHANGE -->
    <p>Gujarat, located in <b>western India</b>, is famous for its rich wildlife, local handicrafts, beautiful temples, and historical landmarks.

        Gujarat's cuisine is known for its unique blend of sweet and tangy flavours, attributed to the particular use of jaggery or gur in many savoury dishes. While Gujarat is known for its sweetness, it is not uniform across the state. In regions like South Gujarat, preferences lean towards spicier or more savoury flavours, often avoiding the use of sugar entirely. Gujurat is predominantly vegetarian, with a focus on seasonal vegetables, although certain communities do eat meat and seafood as part of their normal diet.
