    <h1><span>Tamil Nadu</span></h1> <!-- CHANGE -->
    <p>Tamil Nadu is a <b>south Indian state</b> known for its temples, rich history, and artistic heritage.
        <br>
        <br>
        At the heart of Tamil Nadu's cuisine are rice-and-lentil-based dishes complemented by an array of spicy curries. Commonly used ingredients include tamarind, coconut, curry leaves, and buttermilk. Notably, Tamil Nadu is considered to be the origin of the English word 'curry,' derived from the Tamil word 'kari'.
        <br>
        <br>
        Thanks to its extensive maritime history and trade connections with various nations and regions, Tamil Nadu's cuisine has evolved to incorporate a wealth of influences.
