    <h1><span>Chandigarh</span></h1> <!-- CHANGE -->
    <p>Chandigarh, <b>an Indian Union Territory and the shared capital of Punjab and Haryana</b>, holds a unique position in India's history and urban planning. Established as a planned city post-independence, Chandigarh stands as a symbol for India's freedom and its future as an independent nation. Designed by the Swiss-French architect Le Corbusier, the city boasts spacious green areas, orderly neighbourhoods, and a vibrant community spirit.
        <br>
        <br>
        Chandigarhâ€™s cuisine draws heavily from Punjabi cuisine, which is known for its bold spices and rich flavours. Chandigarh's street food is particularly famous, and filled with indulgent dished from samosas and chaat to lassi and chai.
