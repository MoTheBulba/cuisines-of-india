    <h1><span>Chana Madra</span></h1> <!-- CHANGE -->
    <p>Chana madra is a Himachali dish made with <b>chickpeas in a spiced yogurt-based sauce</b>.
        <br>
        <br>While this dish is remarkably simple and quick to prepare, make sure to avoid curdling the yogurt when adding it to the tempered spices. Variations of madra dishes can also be made by substituting chickpeas with other legumes like kidney beans or black-eyed beans. Commonly enjoyed at home and during festivals, chana madra pairs well with rice or a variety of flatbreads.
