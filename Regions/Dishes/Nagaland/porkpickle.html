    <h1><span>Pork Pickle</span></h1> <!-- CHANGE -->
    <p>Pork pickle is <b>a spicy pickle with a strong flavour made with smoked pork</b> and popular in Nagaland.
        <br>
        <br>
        The recipes can vary widely, with common ingredients being Sichuan peppers, dried bamboo shoots, and axone â€“ fermented soybeans. While axone contributes to the unique flavour profile of this pickle, it may be challenging to find and can be omitted if necessary.

        Despite its simplicity, Nagaland's pork pickle relies on a generous quantity of ingredients for its distinctive strong flavour. It is crucial to use fatty pork, as the fat content plays a vital role in preserving the pickle. Additional oil can be added if the pork does not have enough fat.
