    <h1><span>Khaman/Nylon Khaman/Dhokla</span></h1> <!-- CHANGE -->
    <p>Khaman, nylon khaman, and dhokla all refer to a <b>steamed savoury cake made topped with a spicy, tempered syrup</b>.
        <br>
        <br>
        The cake itself is plain and is transformed into a delicious treat when the syrup is poured over it. It is best enjoyed with chutney and tea.
        <br>
        <br>
        Each variation uses different ingredients for the cake, yet they all use the same cooking method: steaming the batter and topping it with a tempered syrup. 
        <ol>
            <li><i>Nylon khaman</i> is made with fine gram flour, giving it a soft and spongy texture</li>
            <li><i>Khaman</i> uses ground chana dal and offers a slightly textured cake</li>
            <li><i>Dhokla</i> is made with ground rice and urad dal, that gives it a more savoury and textured taste</li>
        </ol>
