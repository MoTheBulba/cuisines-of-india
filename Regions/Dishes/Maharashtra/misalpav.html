    <h1><span>Misal Pav</span></h1> <!-- CHANGE -->
    <p>Misal Pav is a popular comforting street food. It consists of a <b>flavourful curry made from sprouted moth beans, generously topped with raw red onions, fresh coriander, and farsan.</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        Served alongside soft bread rolls known as pav, misal pav is an explosion of wonderful textures and flavours. While the curry itself is flavourful, it is the vibrant array of toppings that truly elevates this dish, with the raw red onions playing a particularly crucial role that brings the flavours together. Misal pav is often served with buttermilk and papadum, but it can also be enjoyed on its own.
