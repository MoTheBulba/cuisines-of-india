    <p>Bedmi poori is <b>a deep-fried flatbread made from a blend of ground urad dal and aromatic spices.</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        Commonly enjoyed as a breakfast dish or popular street food, it offers a comforting and indulgent experience. In contrast to conventional pooris found in various regions of India, bedmi poori distinguishes itself with its crispier texture, heavier consistency, and more flavoursome profile. While its precise origins are debated, it is commonly associated with Uttar Pradesh, although some sources attribute its creation to Delhi or Maharashtra. Regardless of its origins, bedmi poori has garnered widespread popularity throughout Uttar Pradesh and often eaten with aloo sabzi.
