    <h1><span>Rajasthan</span></h1> <!-- CHANGE -->
    <p>Rajasthan is <b>a northern state in India</b>, famed for its rich history, magnificent architecture, and vibrant art.
        <br>
        <br>
        Its cuisine, predominantly vegetarian, is characterised by rustic, spicy dishes rich in flavour. Rajasthani cuisine relies heavily on ingredients like lentils, beans, legumes, and dairy products. Its cuisine evolved in response to the challenges posed by the region's arid landscape and limited water resources.
        <br>
        <br>
        With fresh produce scarce, Rajasthani cooks turned to ingredients that could be stored for extended periods, such as lentils, to create hearty and satisfying meals. Dairy, in particular, plays a significant role in Rajasthani cooking, serving as a vital source of hydration in a region where water conservation is paramount.
