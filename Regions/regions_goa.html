        Goan cuisine is a wonderful fusion of Portuguese and Indian flavours, reflecting its rich history. Seafood and meat, notably pork and beef, are prominent across Goan cuisine, accompanied by tangy ingredients such as tamarind, kokum, and vinegar. Seafood dishes are often cooked with coconut milk and an array of spices, while meats are frequently marinated and cooked in vinegar. Cashew nuts and red chillies are abundant in Goan recipes, lending a unique depth of flavour and the characteristic vibrant red colour seen in many popular Goan dishes.
