    <p>Mutton atthey is <b>a mutton 'confit' curry cooked in ghee.</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        While many variations exist, the Deoghar-style mutton atthey, named after the renowned religious city in Jharkhand, is particularly popular. This dish is often dubbed a 'vegetarian' mutton curry as it does not use typical meat curry ingredients like onions or garlic.
        <br>
        <br>
        Known for its tenderness and indulgence, mutton atthey is a delicious dish that is great for serving at gatherings and special occasions. Additionally, it holds cultural significance, commonly offered at temples and found widely at festival celebrations.
