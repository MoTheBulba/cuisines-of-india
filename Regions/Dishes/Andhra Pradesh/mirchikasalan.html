    <h1><span>Mirchi Ka Salan</span></h1> <!-- CHANGE -->
    <p>Mirchi ka Salan is a <b>thin peanut and coconut-based curry with whole chilies</b>, and is popular in Hyderabadi cuisine (Hyderabad being the capital of Telangana*).
        <br>
        <br>The dish is typically served alongside biryani that complements its rich flavour. The term “mirchi” means chili, and “salan” means curry or gravy, essentially meaning a “curry of chilies” or just “chili curry”. If the dish proves too spicy, you can scoop out the chili innards (seeds and membranes) before cooking. Alternatively, enjoy it alongside a cooling raita or plain yogurt. There are also different kinds of salan (i.e. a curry side dish for biriyani), such salans with aubergines, tomatoes, meat, fish, and more.

        *As you clicked Andra Pradesh, you might be wondering why this post mentions Telegana. Hyderabad is currently the capital of Telangana, but was previously the capital of Andhra Pradesh before the state was split. In 2014, the Telegu-speaking region of Andra Pradesh officially became its own state – Telangana.
